**Objective:**

The primary objective of this project was to build a predictive machine learning model capable of classifying outcomes from a dataset. The specific task focused on creating an effective and transparent spam email detector.

**Key Objectives:**

**.** Data Preparation: A sample dataset of emails and their corresponding labels (spam or ham) was created and loaded.

**.** Text Vectorization: The raw text data was converted into a numerical format using scikit-learn's CountVectorizer, which is necessary for machine learning algorithms.

**.** Model Training: A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the processed data. This algorithm is highly suitable for text classification problems.

**.** Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix to understand its effectiveness and identify potential weaknesses.

**.** Prediction: The final model was used to make predictions on new, unseen email texts.

**Technologies Used:**

**.** Python: The core programming language for the project.

**.** Scikit-learn: The primary library used for machine learning, including data splitting, text vectorization, and model training.

**.** Pandas: Used for efficient data handling and manipulation.

**.** Matplotlib & Seaborn: Utilized for creating visualizations, specifically the confusion matrix, to better understand model performance.

**.** Jupyter Notebook: The interactive environment used to develop and present the code, analysis, and results in a single document.
